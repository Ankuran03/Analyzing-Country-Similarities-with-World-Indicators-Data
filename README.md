Clustering Methods on Synthetic and Real-World Data

Introduction:

This project aims to implement different clustering methods on synthetic and real-world data and validate the results using external and internal validation techniques. The clustering methods used in this project are K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.

Data Sets:

The synthetic data sets used in this project are: "Data1.csv", "Data2.csv", "Data3.csv", "Data4.csv", "Data5.csv", "Data6.csv", "Data7.csv", and "Data8.csv". These data sets contain the data points and their respective class information. The real-world data set used in this project is the "World Indicators" dataset which compares different countries based on selected attributes.

Task 1:

In this task, the objective is to implement K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering on the synthetic data sets and validate the results using external validation metrics. The steps followed in this task are:

Use K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to generate clusters on each of the synthetic data sets.
Evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithms using external validation metrics.
Plot (2D or 3D) the data points for each synthetic data set and color them according to the original class.
Plot (2D or 3D) the data points for each synthetic data set and color them according to the class allocated by the clustering algorithm.

Task 2:

In this task, the objective is to implement K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering on the "World Indicators" data set and validate the results using internal validation metrics. The steps followed in this task are:

Use K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to group similar countries together.
Use internal validation metrics to report the cluster quality.
Report the best clustering solution and give a detailed list of all the groups and the countries included within the groups.
Generate three different scatter plots of your choice and color the data points according to the group.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Sklearn

Conclusion:

This project provides an understanding of different clustering methods and their implementation on synthetic and real-world data. The results obtained from the implementation of these clustering methods are validated using both external and internal validation techniques. This project also provides a clear understanding of the limitations and strengths of different clustering methods and how to choose the best clustering solution based on the data and the problem at hand.
